Introduction to Snake Game
The Snake Game is a classic game that has been popular for several decades. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around on a board, trying to eat food and avoid running into walls or the snake's own tail. This project is a console-based implementation of the Snake Game in C++. 

Objective: 
The main objective of this project is to create a simple and fun game that can be played in the console window. It is also an opportunity to practice C++ programming and learn about game development.


Features:
-	The game has a simple UI, with the game board and the score displayed in the console window.
-	The snake is controlled using arrow keys.
-	The snake grows longer as it eats food, making the game progressively more challenging.
-	The game ends when the snake eats its own tail.
-	The player score is displayed at the end of the game.
